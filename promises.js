// Promise 

// When do we need async code in project?
// One very common need is when we want to make out project or website INTERACTIVE

// A promise ca be created with new Promise()
// Promise take a function as an argument


function executor(resolve, reject) {
    console.log("Executor function called....");
    ///

    /// Do some logic.  Call some webservice to get some data
    // Example: youtube API to get some details of videos

    // This youtube API will retrn some response
    // The response can be good or error
    // You need to undertsnad what response it has returned.
    // Is it good or error


    // If API response is good.
    //  Then call resolve and pass the response to it
    //resolve(APIresponse);

    // If my logial outcome is not good, then call rejet() and pass the error to it
    setTimeout(()=>{
        //reject(" The API failed to return video list...");
        resolve();
    }, 3000);
}

let p1 = new Promise(executor);

p1.then(function(youtubeAPIResponse) {
    console.log("Then called.....");

    // Process the response
    // take the details for youtube API and display the video list

    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        //resolve();
        reject();
    })

}).then(function() {
    console.log(" Second then called......")
})

p1.catch(function(errMsg){
    console.log(errMsg);
})
//=================
// Promise is for future commitment
// fulfill the promise (resolve)
// break the promise (reject)
// YOU as a developer have the CONTROL to fulfill or break promise
// YOU as a developer have to call resolve() or reject() method.
// 
// Where to call these methods?
// You need to call these in your executor function.

// If resolved, then it will execute the p1.then part of your code
// If rejected, then it will execute the p1.catch part of your code

// How do you pass the APIresponse from Promise to the 'then' callback function
//    You can directly pass it as an argument to resolve function

// How do you pass the APIresponse from Promise to the 'catch' callback function
//    You can directly pass it as an argument to reject function
